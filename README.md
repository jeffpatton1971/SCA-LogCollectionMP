SCA-LogCollectionMP
===================

This is a small Management Pack I created in order to send some custom logs up to System Center Advisor. I'm using the VSAE to build this MP out, at the moment it only contains a handful of rules to collect the various logs I'm interested in.

This is always the latest version of the MP

The rules are all disabled by default, you will want to enable them by groups most likely, at least that's what works the best for me. As I start getting more comfortable using VSAE I will most likely make this more full featured.
